# Markdown content here: {title}

More general markdown can render here. Including scripts:

```js
// JavaScript goes here,
// And will be syntax-highlighted!
// use to demo lots of things, I suppose
console.log('you could note that this is how it works')
```

<BlogMatter />

## More markdown _here_!
1. I can write however it makes sense
1. numbered lists  
(or nothing)
1. Or continuations of the list

## Or a whole new heading
1. Or a whole new list
